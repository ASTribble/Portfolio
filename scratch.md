About Me:

I love to build useful objects.

I have been doing it my whole life. 

I love to learn new ways to build anything useful. 

I've built props for theaters, sets for movies, shelves for books, and violins for musicians.  I've built a pizza oven in my backyard and a shelter for it when it started to rain. I've baked pies (they are very useful - ask your belly), and sewn costumes.

My love of making things has brought me to web development. I see it as a new way to make useful things for real people.

I would love to build something for you.

Something useful.  

That works.
