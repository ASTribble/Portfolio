Study Group came about as I was looking for a problem in my personal environment to solve.
My code school is an online program that happens to have many students in the Portland area.  
People in the program often try to schedule study sessions in Slack, and I thought there could be a better way.

Study Group was built with React and Redux on the front end, 
MongoDB with Mongoose for storage, and Node.js with Express to connect the two.
