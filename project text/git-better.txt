When asked to build a learning app, Git jumped to mind immediately as 
something I wanted to... um... get better at. 
Git Better uses a spaced-repitition algorithm to make questions you miss 
show back up more frequently than questions you get right.

Git Better was built with React and Redux on the front-end, Node.js with Express on the back, 
and everything is stored in a MongoDB database with a Mongoose interface.
