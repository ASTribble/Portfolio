Centsible is an investment teaching application.
It was built by five people, in three weeks, with an agile methodology. 

I was the project's design-lead, so after the initial components were in place 
most of my time was spent on styling.

I also had a large role in the planning of the project - I created the team wireframes and 
worked with our project manager to break them into actionable stories in Clubhouse.

We used React and Redux on the front end, Node.js for our server, and a Mongo database. 
We used TravisCI for continuous integration, and Mocha, Chai, Enzyme, and Jest for testing.
Workflow was managed with Clubhouse.io and Github, and I built the wireframes on moqups.com.
