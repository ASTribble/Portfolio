I am a life-long builder of things living in Portland, Oregon with my partner and our toddler.

I've built props for theaters, instruments for musicians, sets for puppets, 
and a pizza oven in my backyard.  Each new effort expands both my knowledge 
of the world and my knowledge of how much there still is to learn.

For the past four years, I've been working as a backend engineer primarily in Scala and with a 
smattering of other languages.  My team utilizes AWS services to build 
distributed scaleable micro-services with millions of users. 

I began my journey in the virtual world in 2017 when I enrolled in  
a five-month-long immersive course in software engineering.  That program focused on building full-stack
Javascript web applications with Node/Express backends and React/Redux frontends.

I'm always interested in taking on new challenges and learning new things. I ask a lot 
of questions and I'm always happy to help others when I can.   

I would love to explore the space where the physical and virtual worlds collide.
